### What makes a computer a computer?

- A computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).

### What is Binary?

- Computers don’t understand words or numbers the way humans do. Modern software allows the end user to ignore this, but at the lowest levels of your computer, everything is represented by a binary electrical signal that registers in one of two states: on or off. To make sense of complicated data, your computer has to encode it in binary.

- Binary is a base 2 number system. Base 2 means there are only two digits—1 and 0—which correspond to the on and off states your computer can understand. You’re probably familiar with base 10—the decimal system. Decimal makes use of ten digits that range from 0 to 9, and then wraps around to form two-digit numbers, with each digit being worth ten times more than the last (1, 10, 100, etc.). Binary is similar, with each digit being worth two times more than the last.

### How do logic circuits work?

- When a transistor is on, or open, then an electric current can flow through. ... When you string a bunch of these transistors together, then you get what's called a logic gate, which lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide binary numbers in any way imaginable. In a physical circuit, these logic gates have: Inputs.

### How computers work the CPU and memory?

- The hardware that defines a computer is the CPU and memory . ... The CPU and memory work together to run programs. CPU - executes programs using the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Memory - stores program operations and data while a program is being executed .

### What is hardware and software in computer?

- Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your computer's hard drive. For example, the computer monitor you are using to read this text and the mouse you are using to navigate this web page are computer hardware.

### How does software work with hardware?

- Essentially, computer software controls computer hardware. These two components are complementary and cannot act independently of one another. In order for a computer to effectively manipulate data and produce useful output, its hardware and software must work together. Without software, computer hardware is useless.
