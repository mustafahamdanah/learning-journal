## How javascript makes web page more interactive :

1. ACCESS CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
- Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
- Select any elements that have a
c1ass attribute with a value of note
- Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of emai1

2. MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
- Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
- Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
- Change the size or position of an
<i mg> element 

3. PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page

### A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following: 
- RECIPES 
- HANDBOOKS
- MANUALS 

### WRITING A SCRIPT

-To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.

### ARRAYS 

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

### VALUES IN ARRAYS 

- NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY 
- ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY 
- NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY 

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
