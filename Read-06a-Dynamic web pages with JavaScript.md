## JavaScript

### These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. 


### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. 

## Linking JS file and Html

- When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 

### States in JS

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon. 

### Variables in JS

- A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

### DATA TYPES
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.

1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE
2. STRING DATA TYPE
3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE


## Read 06 steps:

1. Create new repo on GitHub and name it practice-js
2. Clone this repo on your computer locally inside projects folder
3. Go to https://github.com/LTUC/amman-102d3/ and clone this repo on your computer locally
inside projects folder
4. Now, we want to copy a starter code from class-06 folder that is inside the amman-102d6 repo
to our repo practice-js using this command:

### cp -r amman-102d3/class-06/starter-code/* practice-js

5. Open your practice-js project on Vscode
6. Create new HTML file and name it add-content.html and copy the following code inside it
7. Create new folder and name it (js) then create a file inside this folder and name add-content.js
and copy the following code inside it.
8. Open the HTML file in your browser. You should see that the JavaScript has added a greeting (in
this case, Good Afternoon!) to the page. (These greetings are coming from the JavaScript file;
they are not in the HTML file.)
