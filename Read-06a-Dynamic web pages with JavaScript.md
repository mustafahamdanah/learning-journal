3. Go to https://github.com/LTUC/amman-102d3/ and clone this repo on your computer locally

4. Now, we want to copy a starter code from class-06 folder that is inside the amman-102d6 repo
to our repo practice-js using this command:

### cp -r amman-102d3/class-06/starter-code/* practice-js

5. Open your practice-js project on Vscode
6. Create new HTML file and name it add-content.html and copy the following code inside it
7. Create new folder and name it (js) then create a file inside this folder and name add-content.js
and copy the following code inside it.
8. Open the HTML file in your browser. You should see that the JavaScript has added a greeting (in
this case, Good Afternoon!) to the page. (These greetings are coming from the JavaScript file;
they are not in the HTML file.)
